title: 30/08/2019: Removal of `fakeroot`
category: news
---

The `fakeroot` package is no longer used by the package manager. Instead each package is built and archived with the ownership of whatever user ran the package manager.

On installation of a package the files are then installed with the ownership set to `root:root` achieving the same behavior in the end as `fakeroot`.

`fakeroot` is a nasty hack and adds quite a lot of overhead to builds. I am now able to rebuild GCC in only 10 minutes!

Steps for removal of `fakeroot`.

- Update `kiss` to `0.10.0`.
- Remove `fakeroot` (`kiss remove fakeroot`).
