title: 23/08/2019: KISS repository split
category: news
---

The `public` repository was split from the main repositories and renamed to `community`. This change was made to reflect the split in maintainer responsibility. This repository is now disabled by default.

It goes to say that the KISS developers are not solely responsible for maintaining packages in this repository. By enabling this repository you accept the risks of a curated community repository.

To enable `community` follow the instructions here: <https://getkiss.org/pages/installation/#enable-the-community-repository>
