title: 04/08/2019: Firefox has been built.
category: news

After hours of build attempts of both Chromium and Firefox, we have successfully packaged Firefox. Chromium is a story for another time. The build systems for these two browsers border on insanity and their overall size and complexity is paramount.

- Firefox requires both GTK2 and GTK3. GTK2 is required only for flash. \[1\]
- Both Chromium and Firefox require `nodejs` to build.
- Both Chromium and Firefox require Python 2.
- Both browsers bundle all of their required third-party libraries and they cannot all be set to use the system's.
- `clang` is now the default and "supported" compiler of both browsers.
- Firefox requires a version of `automake` which is 18(?) years old. \[2\] \[3\]
- Firefox requires `rust` which was painful to package for `musl` to say the least.
- Chromium's build scripts require `python2` yet call `python` which points to `python3`.
- A large number of patches were needed for both to support `musl`.
- Both browsers depend on GTK+3 which depends on `dbus`. This dependency was removed by using a fake `atk` library.
- ALSA audio support is being removed from Firefox. This includes the configure flag to enable it.
- This will be updated as I remember things.
