title: "31/10/2019: ninja replaced by samurai"
---

The build tool `ninja` has been replaced with `samurai`. 

This replacement is 1:1 compatible with `ninja`, absolutely tiny in size, doesn't require `python` to build and is simply *simpler*.

The one downside is that a smidgen of manual intervention is required. Simply remove `ninja` and run `kiss update`.

The sources for Samurai can be found here: <https://github.com/michaelforney/samurai>
