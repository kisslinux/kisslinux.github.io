title: "31/08/2019: Removal of ca-certificates"
---

KISS now uses the certificates bundled with `libressl`.

Steps for removal of `ca-certificates`.

- `kiss build libressl`
- `kiss remove ca-certificates`
- `rm -rf /etc/ssl`
- `kiss install libressl`

**Update**: A script is also provided in `/etc/ssl` to update the certificate bundle independently of the package manager.
