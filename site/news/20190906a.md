title: "06/09/2019: Firefox updated to 69.0"
---

I thought Firefox 69.0 would not be possible on KISS due to the new unconditional dependency on `dbus`. I have written a patch which removes this dependency and allows us to build it again!

Firefox 69.0 introduces something called `audio_thread_priority` and from what I understand it's a way to prioritize audio threads when needed. This entire "feature" works using `dbus` to do IPC on Linux and subsequently breaks the `--disable-dbus` configure flag.

The patch I have written disables `audio_thread_priority` and in turn causes audio to work the same as it did in 68.0 and below.
