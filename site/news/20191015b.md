title: "15/10/2019: New python release (3.8.0), manual intervention needed"
---

A new **major** version of `python` has been released which requires a rebuild of the following packages.

- python-mako
- meson

Steps:

- `kiss update` (*update Python first*).
- `kiss b python-mako meson`
- Press **Return** afterwards to install the rebuilt packages.

Note:

- I am looking into automating this, stay tuned.
