Website
________________________________________________________________________________

This website is rather unique. Each page is plain-text which is inserted into
some &lt;pre&gt; tags in a template. The template also contains the CSS,
favicon, GitHub icon, content and HTML. Every page is entirely self-contained
and a page load of this website is only a single network request.

[100] Favicon
________________________________________________________________________________

The favicon is a base64 encoded gif image which I created. It is designed to
take up as little space as possible.

&lt;link href='data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAQAPH/AAAAAP8AAP8AN////yH5BAUAAAQ
ALAAAAAAQABAAAAM2SLrc/jA+QBUFM2iqA2bAMHSktwCCWJIYEIyvKLOuJt+wV69ry5cfwu7WCVp2RSP

  [101] Why Use A Favicon At All?
  ____________________________________________________________________________

  The funny thing about web browsers is that they will assume a favicon exists
  despite this possibly being false. Browsers will try to load it and you'll
  end up with error 404 and a wasted request.

  Providing some kind of inline favicon is the only way to quiet the browser
  and prevent it from trying to load something that does not exist. Prior to
  creating the above favicon, this website used the following snippet.

  &lt;link href=data:, rel=icon&gt;

  Through a lot of tinkering I found that this is the smallest possible (inline)
  favicon. This successfully shushes the web request in all tested browsers.


[200] GitHub Icon
________________________________________________________________________________

The GitHub icon in the navigation bar is also a base64 encoded gif image (of my
creation). It is a 16x16 version of the GitHub logo.

&lt;img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAQAPABAAAAAP//ACH5BAUIAAEALAAAAAAQ
