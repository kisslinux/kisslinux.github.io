title: "28/08/2019: Why does GTK3 Firefox require GTK2?"
---

Firefox only supports Linux builds with GTK3 for some time now, however GTK2 is still a mandatory dependency. It turns out that GTK2 is required for NPAPI plugins and the **only** plugin which is still in use is the Flash Plugin!

You cannot disable NPAPI plugin support which means that **Firefox has a dependency on GTK2 solely for Flash**. The sole reason that KISS ships GTK2 is for Firefox, Flash will die some time in 2020 (*possibly 2021*) so until then we're stuck with GTK2.

Source:

> As long as NPAPI plugins are supported, build dependency on gtk2 cannot be dropped.

> NPAPI is currently only around to support Flash (bug 1269807). Per https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Plugins/Roadmap, Firefox's Flash support (and thus NPAPI support) will be removed sometime in 2020.
