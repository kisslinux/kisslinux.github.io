**NOTE:** This only affects existing installations.

Starting from version `0.12.0` of the package manager, the cache directory is now located at `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/kiss` (*`~/.cache/kiss` if the `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` variable is unset*).

This change was made to prevent a potential security issue when KISS is used on a multi-user system. The cache is now effectively local to each user.

The system-wide `/var/cache/kiss` directory is no longer used by the package manager. If you would like to keep your current cache, you will need to relocate it to the new location mentioned above.
