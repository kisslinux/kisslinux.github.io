* Why should I use KISS?

  That's up to you to decide.

  I'm not going to try and sell you something I'm giving away for
  free. Have a read of the website and its wealth of information,
  try KISS in a virtual machine (a chroot is also an option) and
  come to your own conclusions.


* What does KISS mean?

  KISS is an acronym for "Keep it simple stupid" (notice _no_ comma).

  Stupid does not refer to the user. To quote Wikipedia:

  > The principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing
    a team of design engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge
    that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by
    an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with
    only these tools.

  > Hence, the "stupid" refers to the relationship between the way
    things break and the sophistication available to repair them.


* Is KISS rolling release or stable?

  Packages are updated as quickly as possible while at the same time
  tested to ensure that no issues arise in the new version. A new
  version of a package will be held back if it causes issues.

  When a package update brings in a bug during the build process or
  at runtime, it will be patched in KISS until it is fixed upstream.
  This will typically happen hours after the version is available
  and doesn't cause a delay.

  Nothing prevents you as a user from choosing the update schedule
  you would prefer. Total control is in your hands. KISS merely
  provides you with an always up-to-date repository pool.


* Something something BUS factor of ONE.

  Every user of the distribution owns their system in its entirety.
  The management of the distribution which extends to the management
  of updates to the user's system is entirely optional.

  All KISS systems contain the full sources for the distribution and
  each user has the means of managing and maintaining their machine
  on their lonesome (or by forming a collective and secondary
  "upstream").

  This includes:

  - The repositories with full git history.

    The repository updates are simply a 'git pull' which results in
    each user having a full copy of the git repositories on their
    machine at /var/db/kiss/.

  - The package manager and the kiss-* scripts.

    As these are all simple shell scripts, the installed "binaries"
    _are_ the unchanged source code. All of these are self-contained
    and separate programs.

    The 'kiss-outdated' script allows one to check their system for
    outdated packages against the repology.org database independent
    of whether or not repology has support for KISS itself.

    The 'kiss-export' script allows one to convert an installed
    package back into a redistributable and installable binary
    tarball. Simply run 'kiss-export pkg_name' and a tarball will be
    created in the current directory.

  - The distribution's documentation.

    As the website sources are merely plain .txt files, the docs are
    available in /usr/share/doc/kiss and are readable in less,
    vim or the program of your choosing.

  - The init scripts.

    In addition to the reasoning given for the package manager above,
    KISS has no lock-in regarding how the machine boots. Were the
    init scripts to disappear, there would be no real loss.

    To continue further, the init scripts need not change. There is
    no need to update them. Any extensions to them can be made via
    the /etc/rc.d directory or the /etc/rc.conf file.

  What all of this means is that were the GitHub or website to go
  down, there would be no loss in code, documentation or the
  distribution itself.

  It also extends to each user having everything they will need to
  continue the distribution for themselves or for other users. A
  change of git remote is all that is needed in the latter case.

  KISS was designed to be maintainable by a single person. The
  repositories are kept small and focused. There is no requirement
  or _need_ for infrastructure of any kind.

  A user today could choose to go their own way with their system.
  Everything they need is already in the existing system. The power
  is in your hands. You are free.

* Why isn't SOFTWARE packaged?

  No one has packaged it yet.


* Can you package SOFTWARE for me?

  Do it yourself.


* What init does KISS use?

  KISS uses busybox init by default. There is however, no lock-in and
  the user may use whatever they like. The distribution's boot up
  scripts are written in an init-agnostic way and act as a base for
  every init to use.


* What coreutils does KISS use?

  KISS uses busybox coreutils by default. There is however, no
  lock-in and the user may use whatever they like. All shell code is
  written in portable POSIX shell and coreutils invocations.

  * One exception is made for 'sed -i' which isn't POSIX but is far
    too useful to do away with. Many sed implementations include -i
    so this is more of a non-issue.

  * The tar command has no standard interface, however support is
    included for busybox tar, libarchive tar (bsdtar), GNU tar and
    others.

  * Some utilities have no standard specification and where their use
    is required, we adhere to common options between implementations.

  Barring the above exceptions, users are running KISS without the
  use of busybox. Popular alternatives are Suckless' sbase/ubase and
  GNU's set of core utilities.

* How do I remove a package and all of its dependencies?

  Short answer: With one command? You can't.

  The package manager does not do recursive dependency removal on
  removal of a package. This error-prone automation will not be
  added to the package manager.

  Instead, the workflow is to remove the single package and then look
  at the output of the 'kiss-orphans' command to see what can now be
  removed. This command will list all packages which have no
  relationship with other packages, otherwise known as orphans.

  This list may include Firefox and other "end" software so a brain
  is required when parsing the list. You'll come to learn the
  relationships between packages and their dependencies and this will
  eventually become effortless.

* Why doesn't my kernel boot?

  The kernel not booting can be a variety of issues. This is almost
  always related to a configuration issue in the kernel, /etc/fstab
  or the bootloader.

  KISS doesn't use an initramfs so the configuration of the kernel
  may have different requirements to other distributions.

  1. The drivers for your disk controller, drives and filesystems
     must not be built as kernel modules. They should be set to =y
     in your .config or [*] when using make menuconfig.

     Essentially, every driver the kernel requires to detect and
     mount the drive containing the root filesystem, must be built
     as a part of the kernel binary.

  2. Multi-drive systems must use PARTUUID or UUID in place of
     /dev/sdXX in the bootloader configuration to ensure that the
     kernel will find the right drive.


* Why doesn't KISS support initramfs?

  KISS technically supports booting via an initramfs, it just doesn't
  require or provide one. As a user you have the means to set this up
  yourself for your system.

  Full disk encryption is also possible without the use of an
  initramfs in modern kernels (see dm-mod.create).

  The initramfs concept is an ugly, complicated and largely optional
  mess. Thank god it isn't a requirement.


* Why must I compile my own kernel?

  The kernel must be compiled by the user for a variety of reasons.

  1. The user maintains full control over all aspects of their kernel
     and further, their entire system. There is no lock-in into a
     specific set of kernel sources, version, use of proprietary
     firmware, patches, config, etc.

     The user decides:

     - Which kernel to use (sources and version).
     - When to update their kernel.
     - Whether to use proprietary firmware blobs.
     - Which patches to use (if any).
     - How the kernel is configured (endless options).
     - How many kernels they'd like to keep.
     - Compiler options (-O3, -march=native, etc).

     You as a user might actually learn something too. You may come
     to understand your hardware, what drivers it needs, how the
     kernel works from a configuration perspective, etc.

     You should have a better understanding of this part of the
     system afterwards and you'll be able fix any issues at this
     level with relative ease.

     Remember, it's only hard the first time. Once a working config
     is created, no further work should need to be done each time you
     update your kernel.

     If the new kernel version has an issue with your hardware,
     simply boot another from your backups. If new hardware was
     added, simply run 'make menuconfig' and add what is needed.

     I'll say what I always say. Nothing prevents anyone from
     providing kernel binaries and an initramfs generation tool for
     KISS. Just don't wait on the BDFL to do it for you.

  2. Eases distribution maintenance for the BDFL. Shipping a generic
     kernel demands a humongous, module heavy kernel with support for
     everything under the sun. An initramfs is then a requirement to
     boot this damn monstrosity.

     There is then a need for a _portable_ initramfs generation tool
     which to my knowledge doesn't exist. There can't be a dependence
     on bash or anything outside of core. All initramfs tools are
     either distribution-specific or non-portable to KISS.

     Then there'd be endless support requests for tweaks, additions
     and removals to the distribution config and the burden of
     updating the kernel on every release.

     Does KISS ship the latest kernel? The long term support kernel?
     Both? Some users require firmware so we'd need two separate
     binaries, one for linux-libre and another for regular linux.

     What if the latest kernel has issues on some hardware? New
     builds and binaries must be released with backported patches.

     It's a large maintenance burden for something which can simply
     be solved by the user doing this themselves. The user maintains
     full control over every aspect of their kernel and is solely
     responsible for it.


* Why doesn't KISS provide kernel sources as a package?

  Why should it? See above.


* Must I keep the linux-headers package in sync with my kernel's
  version to maintain a working system?

  The kernel headers in KISS are pinned to an LTS kernel version
  and are only updated when there are changes of interest in the
  kernel or headers themselves (usually by users requesting new
  features available in the newer headers).

  The headers are backwards compatible and are fully usable with a
  matching or NEWER kernel version. There are two cases where you'd
  be required to update the headers yourself.

  1. You'd like to run a kernel _older_ than the default headers.
  2. You'd like to make use of features in your _newer_ kernel version.

  Here's an excerpt from the kernel's documentation which may
  explain the situation better than I.

  > Kernel headers are backwards compatible, but not forwards
    compatible. This means that a program built against a C library
    using older kernel headers should run on a newer kernel (although
    it may not have access to new features), but a program built
    against newer kernel headers may not work on an older kernel.

* C compiler cannot create executables.

  This is almost always an error in your CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS. Ensure that
  you have used -ONUM (CAPITAL O) and not (lowercase o) or (zero 0).

  If the above doesn't fix the issue, try building the package with
  CFLAGS= CXXFLAGS= LDFLAGS= kiss b pkg. You'll then be able to
  discern whether or not this was the issue.

|                             XORG                                  |
|                                                                   |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

* Why can't I start Xorg as a normal user?

  This is likely due to you running 'modprobe amdgpu' or equivalent
  post (or late) boot which causes udev to miss setting up the GPU
  device in /dev/dri.

  There are three separate solutions ranging from easy to hard.
  Either of the three will solve the issue.

  1. Start the udevd service.

     This will keep udevd alive and ensure that it does its thing
     when it detects that the GPU driver has loaded.

     Enabling the service also turns on device hotplug and other
     features. This isn't the default as there's no need for the
     daemon to run on a static system.

     $ ln -s /etc/sv/udevd/ /var/service


  2. Run 'modprobe' earlier in the boot process.

     Running 'modprobe' in your inittab or in rc.d will result in it
     executing _after_ udevd has finished setting up devices.

     By moving 'modprobe' to /etc/rc.conf, it will load the driver
     before udevd executes which will allow it to detect and setup
     the device.


  3. Compile the GPU driver and firmware into the kernel.

     This is trickier but the best solution overall. Instead of using
     modules, compile the firmware into the kernel.

     You'll then not have to worry about udevd/modprobe as the kernel
     will automatically load the driver as early as possible.

     This may include compiling proprietary firmware into the kernel
     as well which is finicky but doable.


* How do I take a screenshot?

  Most users will typically use 'ffmpeg' as their screenshot tool as
  they'll already have ffmpeg installed for MPV or Firefox. Other
  options include 'imlib2' or 'imagemagick' (import).

  If you'd like to use another tool, package it yourself. Remember,
  if no one has packaged something it means that no one has needed
  said package. It is up to you.
