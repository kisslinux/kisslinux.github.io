Here's what people are saying about KISS!


<span id=001>[<a class=t href=#001>001</a>]</span> I just find it interesting that their version of simple includes
      dependency-tracking package management but excludes Spanish.

<span id=002>[<a class=t href=#002>002</a>]</span> Just wanted to say this looks kickass. It is way easier to tear
      things down than to build them.

<span id=003>[<a class=t href=#003>003</a>]</span> I was looking for something like this actually, I thought I would
      finally have to warm up to BSD if I wanted an OS that I have some
      hope of understanding fully.

<span id=004>[<a class=t href=#004>004</a>]</span> Ooh, this is one of those artisan, hand-crafted websites! I'll
      have to post this to my Instagram. I once met an old web developer
      in the south of France who would wash the bytes by hand before
      uploading them to his server. Said it was a family tradition
      passed down for generations.

<span id=005>[<a class=t href=#005>005</a>]</span> I've got a basic installation done! It was actually quite simple!
      Not much is set up, but getting the base down was arguably simpler
      than Arch, and far simpler than Gentoo. I'm not really familiar
      with Busybox, or musl at all, so this should be fun!

<span id=006>[<a class=t href=#006>006</a>]</span> Keep making the biggest problem of Linux bigger, please... Yeah,
      this problem is "fragmentation", and it is not solved with
      "simplicity".

<span id=007>[<a class=t href=#007>007</a>]</span> Oh this touches something deep in me.

<span id=008>[<a class=t href=#008>008</a>]</span> "This distribution has no default desktop or window manager
      environment." - goes to prove that "simple" doesn't mean "easy to
      use"...

<span id=009>[<a class=t href=#009>009</a>]</span> This sounds awesome and very interesting. Going to have try this
      on one of my spare laptops....

<span id=010>[<a class=t href=#010>010</a>]</span> Just what we need, another Linux distribution. Spread the effort
      even more thinly.

<span id=011>[<a class=t href=#011>011</a>]</span> I spent some time on their website, and this really is a wonder
      distribution.

<span id=012>[<a class=t href=#012>012</a>]</span> Literally the opposite of KISS. At lest don't use hypocritical
      excuses for your crusades.

<span id=013>[<a class=t href=#013>013</a>]</span> KISS Linux is a really interesting effort and a sign, IMO, of a
      healthy ecosystem, so I commend Dylan and other contributors for
      their efforts. Great to hear about the aarch64/ppc64le support
      too!

<span id=014>[<a class=t href=#014>014</a>]</span> Ok, what’s your point. You have have musl and libc on a system.
      Not to mention the developer of kids is a outspoken anti systemd
      fud spreader.

<span id=015>[<a class=t href=#015>015</a>]</span> The strength of being simple and small is that I'm in control of
      my own system. When my package manager or init daemon is doing
      something wrong, or is not behaving how I expected it, I can just
      open the shell script and find out why in a few minutes.

<span id=016>[<a class=t href=#016>016</a>]</span> One nice thing about KISS is that everything is hackable and the
      system is small enough, such that mere mortals can wrap their
      heads around it.

<span id=017>[<a class=t href=#017>017</a>]</span> Just as I thought. No actual simplicity, just some neckbeards
      complaining about software evolving in the last 20 years.

<span id=018>[<a class=t href=#018>018</a>]</span> Because of how simple KISS Linux it is, being written completely
      on POSIX shell and all. The entire distro is able to live in just
      one directory in /var. That allows me to base my entire system on
      literally anything I want.

<span id=019>[<a class=t href=#019>019</a>]</span> Well all I can say is grandma won't be installing kiss any time
      soon, looking at the instructions.

<span id=020>[<a class=t href=#020>020</a>]</span> Not gonna lie, the attitude of the maintainer kinda makes my skin
      crawl, but to each their own.
