As of the 20/01/2020, it is now possible to replace eudev with the 
device manager of your choosing. This Wiki page will cover replacing 
eudev with busybox mdev, however the steps are more or less the same 
for all other device managers (smdev, vdev, ...).


CAVEATS

- Xorg will be unable to automatically detect input devices.
- Libinput will be unable to use its quirks system.

- Some packages have an eudev dependency which cannot be removed.
    - lvm2 (*investigation and testing needed*)
        - dm-crypt targets are fully functional when lvm2 is 
          configured without --enable-udev_sync and 
          --enable-udev_rules.
    - xf86-video-nouveau (*investigation and testing needed*)
    - xf86-video-amdgpu (*investigation and testing needed*)


BENEFITS

- Use any device manager, swap between them or use none at all.
- Alternatives are simpler and lighter.
- Faster boot process.
- USER CHOICE!


PREPARATION

* Make note of your current XKB rules, model and layout

  Xorg compiled without udev may require manual configuration to 
  correctly set the keyboard's layout and other settings. The 
  following command can be used to detect the current config from 
  a working machine.

  # (kiss b setxkbmap)
  $ setxkbmap -query
    rules:      evdev
    model:      pc105
    layout:     us

* Make note of your keyboard and mouse's /dev/input/event* entries

  We also need to point Xorg to the input device's device entries in 
  /dev/input. The following command lists all current input devices.

  # (kiss b xinput)
  $ xinput
  ⎡ Virtual core pointer                id=2    [master pointer  (3)]
  ⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer      id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]
  ⎜   ↳ touchpad0                       id=6    [slave  pointer  (2)]
  ⎣ Virtual core keyboard               id=3    [master keyboard (2)]
      ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard     id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]
      ↳ keyboard0                       id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]


  My keyboard has the ID '7'. The following command prints its 
  information including the needed device node location.

  $ xinput --list-props 7
  Device 'keyboard0':
  Device Enabled (169):   1
  libinput Send Events Modes Available (316):     1, 0
  libinput Send Events Mode Enabled (317):        0, 0
  libinput Send Events Mode Enabled Default (318):        0, 0
  Device Node (319):      "/dev/input/event4"
  Device Product ID (320):        1, 1


  The "Device Node (XXX):" line displays the location in /dev of my 
  keyboard and is the value we will use when configuring Xorg. My 
  keyboard is located at /dev/input/event4. This command should be 
  repeated for any other input devices.


CONFIGURING XORG

When Xorg is built without udev, Xorg will be unable to automatically 
find and use input devices. This requires the use of a "static" 
configuration using .conf files.

NOTE: The below files should live in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/.

NOTE: For this example I am configuring a touchpad alongside the 
      keyboard. The 10-touchpad.conf file should be 1:1 transferable 
      to a mouse's configuration.

* 10-keyboard.conf

  The 10-keyboard.conf file is used to tell Xorg how it should setup 
  the keyboard and which device node it should interact with.

  Section "InputDevice"
      Identifier "keyboard0"
      Option     "CoreKeyboard"
      Option     "AutoServerLayout" "true"

      # Use the libinput driver.
      Driver     "libinput"

      # This must point to the '/dev/input'
      # entry of your touchpad or mouse.
      Option     "Device" "/dev/input/event4"

      # Change the values of these to match
      # the detected layout of the command
      # 'setxkbmap -query'.
      Option     "XkbLayout" "us"
      Option     "XkbModel"  "pc105"
      Option     "XkbRules"  "evdev"
  EndSection


* 10-touchpad.conf

  The 10-touchpad.conf file is used to tell Xorg how it should setup 
  the touchpad and which device node it should interact with.

  Section "InputDevice"
      Identifier "touchpad0"
      Option     "CorePointer"
      Option     "AutoServerLayout" "true"

      # Use the libinput driver.
      Driver     "libinput"

      # This must point to the '/dev/input'
      # entry of your touchpad or mouse.
      Option     "Device" "/dev/input/event5"

      # libinput options (optional).
      Option     "ScrollMethod" "twofinger"
      Option     "TappingDrag" "true"
      Option     "Tapping" "true"
  EndSection


PURGING EUDEV

* Disable the udevd service

  NOTE: From this point forward any device manager hotplugging 
        functionality will be unusable.

  $ unlink /var/service/udevd


* Remove the eudev package

  The removal is forced as the packages which depend on eudev will 
  be rebuilt.

  $ KISS_FORCE=1 kiss r eudev


* Generate a list of all packages which need to be rebuilt

  $ kiss-revdepends eudev
  libinput/depends:eudev
  xorg-server/depends:eudev


* Rebuild all required packages

  NOTE: Some packages may have a mandatory dependency on eudev. 
        You may receive errors when attempting to rebuild them. 
        Simply re-install eudev until you are able to investigate 
        further.

  NOTE: If the package manager pulls in eudev as part of the rebuild 
        process, the package you are trying to rebuild has a 
        mandatory dependency on eudev.

  $ kiss b libinput xorg-server


* Verify that the eudev dependence is gone

  The following command should output nothing. If it does not, the 
  outputted packages require a rebuild.

  $ kiss-revdepends eudev


CHANGING DEVICE MANAGERS

* busybox mdev

  Simply enable the `mdev` service.

  ln -s /etc/sv/mdev/ /var/service


* Other device managers

  Open an issue in https://github.com/kisslinux/init as the init 
  scripts will need support for other device managers.


REBOOT

If all went well, you should now be using mdev as your device manager 
while retaining a fully working graphical environment. If input 
doesn't work under Xorg, refer to the Xorg log file for information.
