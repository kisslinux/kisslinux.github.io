Subject	This week in KISS (#15)
From	Dylan Araps &lt;dylan@k1ss.org&gt;
Date	Tue, 16 Mar 2020 15:07:09 +0100

Hello.

It's been a weird week.

All stores (excluding Super Markets, Pharmacies, etc) have been
closed here. People are keeping their distance and most people have
decided to not leave the confines of their homes/yards (me included).

<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6799467/81232157-09ac3500-8ffd-11ea-89c1-00153db00616.jpg">

</a>

The repositories are now ready for GCC 10. Each package has been
tested and fixes have been made to any with issues. GCC 10 snapshots
are available in the testing repository for those wanting to dive
in early.

The perl dependency has been removed from libvpx. Perl was required
solely for the generation of four header files. The package now
simply includes these header files in generated form.

Firefox is now the only package with a dependency on perl. This is
also only a build dependency meaning that there is no runtime
dependency on perl anywhere in the system.

Our gzip implementation has been changed to pigz which is a parallel
version of gzip. Expect speedups when working with large gzipped
sources (depends on your core count of course).


PACKAGE MANAGER

The compression method used for KISS packages is now configurable via
the KISS_COMPRESS environment variable. The current valid values are
gz, xz and bz2.

This same code is shared by the source extraction function which has
the upside of making our tar command usage more portable between tari
implementations.

The final step for maximal tar portability is the removal of the
'--strip-components' flag which limits our compatibility to busybox
tar, libarchive tar (bsdtar) and GNU tar. This is tricky to solve,
any suggestions welcome.


KISS-FORK and KISS-LINK

I added two new utilities which aid in the forking and linking of
packages between repositories.

'kiss-fork <pkg>' will copy the package's repository directory into
your current directory.

'kiss-link <file>' will link a package's repository file to the next
repository in KISS_PATH.

Example:

-> ls
LICENSE.md  README.md  libsass  mesa  pp  sassc  st  wine

-> kiss-fork libdrm
forked package to /home/goldie/dylan-repo/libdrm

-> cd libdrm
-> ls
build      checksums  depends    sources    version

-> kiss-link checksums
linked checksums to /home/goldie/projects/kiss-new/extra/./libdrm
-> kiss-link depends
linked depends to /home/goldie/projects/kiss-new/extra/./libdrm
-> kiss-link sources
linked sources to /home/goldie/projects/kiss-new/extra/./libdrm
-> kiss-link version
linked version to /home/goldie/projects/kiss-new/extra/./libdrm

-> lsl
build
checksums -> /home/goldie/projects/kiss-new/extra/./libdrm/checksums
depends   -> /home/goldie/projects/kiss-new/extra/./libdrm/depends
sources   -> /home/goldie/projects/kiss-new/extra/./libdrm/sources
version   -> /home/goldie/projects/kiss-new/extra/./libdrm/version


The result is a fork of the libdrm package to the user's repository
with every file (except for build) symlinked to the repository
containing libdrm.

This allows the user to make changes to the build process of libdrm
without having to maintain the entire package. The rest of the files
are linked to the official libdrm so any version updates trickle
down.


REMOVING THE NETWORK REQUIREMENT FROM A RUST PACKAGE

First some context. The KISS repositories (excluding community) have
the requirement that no package require an internet connection during
the build process.

What this means is that all network connections made by the package
manager should only be to the static list of sources defined for the
package.

This allows the sources list to be signed via GPG and further allows
the package manager to verify the checksums of everything downloaded.
This finally allows the sources to be cached.

In short, no package should download random stuff during builds. The
package manager should handle this.

Enter cbindgen.

Some packages make this a very difficult thing to pull off. Most
notably Rust and cbindgen. The latter being the package I will talk
about in this post.

The cbindgen package requires a total of 35 crates. This results in
35 additional source downloads we need checksums for. I've come
across packages requiring 200+ crates in my travels.

The process looks like this:

1. Generate a list of each required crate and the required versions
   of each crate. This must be done for the whole dependency chain.

2. Turn the generated list into a list of download URLs for each
   crate. (<a href='https://static.crates.io/crates/atty/atty-0.2.13.crate'>https://static.crates.io/crates/atty/atty-0.2.13.crate</a>)

3. Append the URL list to the sources file. Each crate source should
   also be copied to 'vendor/' so the second field of each source
   must include it.

4. Set the 'CARGO_HOME' environment variable's value to '$PWD' to
   prevent cargo from accessing the user's home directory. We need to
   contain things to the package manager's domain.

5. Extract each crate (really tarballs in disguise). Cargo expects
   them to all be unpacked prior to 'cargo build'.

6. Generate a '.cargo-checksum.json' file for each of the extracted
   crates. The checksum should be of the unextracted crate.

7. Create the '.cargo' directory in '$PWD'. We need to create a cargo
   configuration file for the build to work.

8. Create a configuration file called 'config' in '.cargo'. This file
   will instruct cargo to avoid crates.io when looking for crates and
   to instead look in 'vendor/'.

9. Use the '--frozen' argument with 'cargo build' to prevent cargo
   from accessing the network to look for new crate versions.


Yes. This is the only way to remove the network requirement from a
build of anything using cargo.

If you'd like to see what the resulting package looks like, the
source is available below (comments included!).

NOTE: The maintainer of the software _could_ distribute tarballs
      which include all of the crates via 'cargo vendor' though this
      isn't a common practice from what I've seen.

REMOVING DBUS FROM IWD (AGAIN)

I posted a while ago about my fork of iwd called 'eiwd'. What it is,
is a fork of iwd with the dbus requirement removed. I decided to
start again this week with the intention of handling things
differently the second time around.

The new eiwd touches as little existing code as possible and is
merely a series of '#ifdef HAVE_DBUS' throughout the codebase. I've
also added the '--disable-dbus' configure flag.

It is now possible to use the eiwd sources as a drop-in replacement
for iwd in distributions wanting to optionally enable dbus based on
some kind of conditional (Gentoo USE flags as an example).

The daemon is fully functional and I will _eventually_ get around to
writing a new client to work without dbus.

KISS AND BEDROCK LINUX

A KISS user has successfully run Bedrock Linux with KISS as a strata.

<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6799467/81232208-29435d80-8ffd-11ea-87a2-6c87a18702a8.jpg">

</a>

Bedrock's handling of the system boot/shutdown also uncovered two
minor issues with KISS' init process which have now been fixed.

A big thank you to Bedrock Linux creator Paradigm for helping myself
and the mentioned user to solve any issues.

NOTABLE USER REPOSITORIES

kiss-games

kiss-games is a user repository for KISS which includes a long list
of games and emulators. Any user can add the repository to gain
access to its list of packages.

Source: <a href='https://github.com/sdsddsd1/kiss-games'>https://github.com/sdsddsd1/kiss-games</a>

mywayland

This repository brings Wayland to KISS. It includes Sway, wlroots and
other required packages. Same as above, any user is able to enable
this repository to start running Wayland.

Source: <a href='https://github.com/sdsddsd1/mywayland'>https://github.com/sdsddsd1/mywayland</a>


This is what I was hoping for when creating the repository system and
the imposed limits to the size of the official repositories.

An "ecosystem" of repositories (by users!) which complement and
extend the base system.

I can't wait to see where this will go.


A LITTLE ABOUT MYSELF

KISS has attracted a lot of new users recently. As distributions are
more or less centred around trust, I thought I'd end this week's post
by taking a moment to introduce myself.

* I was born February of 1998 in Melbourne, Australia. Both of my
  parents are of Greek descent. I grew up living with my Mother
  and grandparents. I am 22 years of age.

* I don't own a phone of any kind. The only piece of technology I own
  is my laptop which runs KISS and which I use to work on my
  software. When I leave the house, I'm completely disconnected.

* I've always had an affinity for computers and have tinkered with
  them from a young age. Building my own PCs, messing with console
  homebrew, iPod jailbreaks (what fun they were), etc.

* I dropped out of High School at the age of 13 (after the first
  year) and dedicated all of my time to technology. I was in an
  "accelerated learning" class for my only year.

* I started making websites at 13 from my PC which still ran Windows.
  This progressed to making websites for local businesses.

* I first tried Linux when Valve ran the Tux promotion for Team
  Fortress 2 (<a href='https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Tux'>https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Tux</a>). I kept using
  Linux from this point on.

* My first Linux project came late 2015 when I released the first
  versions of Neofetch (a system information tool).

* Since 2015 I've written a lot of software. wal/Pywal, the Pure bash
  bible, the pure sh bible, fff, pfetch, sowm, KISS Linux etc.

* I started university in 2016 and turned 18 during the first month
  or so. I did two years of a Bachelor's in computer something
  something before transferring to a Journalism bachelor and then
  finally dropping out of that.

* I moved to Greece in 2018 with my Grandmother, Mother, Brother and
  Cousin. I still live here. I didn't speak the language and couldn't
  read/write it either. My Grandfather passed two months prior to us
  leaving.

* I've been homeless two times in my life. Once as a child and the
  second time in 2018 prior to the Greece move. Funny enough we went
  from homelessness in Australia to homelessness in Greece before
  finally setting in somewhere.

* KISS Linux was started from a single room in which myself, my
  brother, cousin, grandmother and mother lived at that time. The
  WiFi came from a cafe across the road, 3 floors down.

  To complicate things further, my grandmother was also dying at this
  time (after having a stroke) and a stray cat had birthed kittens in
  this same room.

  My Grandmother made a recovery though we had another scare in
  January of this current year (2020).

  I now have a permanent place to live and one which I won't jokingly
  call a "Human rights violation". I am still living out of a single
  suitcase though.

* If I were to count the total "house moves" I've made throughout my
  life, I'd end up with a number around 40. 2018 alone had me move
  around 10 or so times.

It's been a wild ride so far, full of its ups and downs. I've omitted
quite a lot as I'll probably write something more in depth elsewhere
(at a later stage). Some things should also probably be left unsaid.

This wasn't meant as a sob story or anything of that nature. Just
a loose and rough timeline of events somewhat related to my Open
Source work. I'm very happy and wouldn't have my life any other way.

I hope this gave you a clearer picture of who I am and more
importantly, why I am.
