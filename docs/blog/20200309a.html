Subject	This week in KISS (#14)
From	Dylan Araps &lt;dylan@k1ss.org&gt;
Date	Tue, 9 Mar 2020 14:07:09 +0100

Hello.

This week I worked on reducing the size of KISS' installation
and rootfs tarball. This involved a myriad of different changes.
The size shrunk from 47.7MB to the new size of 26.7MB.

The installation tarball also doubles as a fully functional
chroot tarball. For those itching to give KISS a test run from
another machine, just extract the tarball and chroot into it.

The entire system can now run without the use of perl. Perl is
now only a compile time dependency for two packages, Firefox
and libvpx.

There is a patch available to build the kernel without perl as
well. Thanks to Ethan Sommer for porting the kernel's perl
script to POSIX shell.

YASM has been removed from the repositories entirely and all
packages which used it prior have been configured to use NASM.

For those using mdev instead of eudev as their device manager,
the boot process is now quicker. This is thanks to the removal
of some redundant and synchronous code from the boot process.

I have timed my system's boot with mdev and the process takes a
single second to complete now. This is down from the previous
two seconds without the change. (Of course, YMMV).

GCC, nodejs, git, binutils and other packages have seen a size
reduction due to the removal of unneeded files. The git package
saw a reduction from 30 or so MB to 4MB from some linker magic
written by Ethan Sommer.

Grub no longer requires Python during the build process. It
turns out that it isn't actually needed at all. Through two
small 'sed' calls, this "false" requirement has been removed.

Grub requires Python to generate some files for the build but 
as it turns out, these files already exist in the release 
tarballs. The build system just forces you to generate them
_again_.


NEOFETCH

Yesterday I released a new version of Neofetch. Version 7.0.0
to be exact. I also worked on streamlining the release process
so that I am able to push updates in shorter intervals.

There will be bugs, there always is. In fact, I've already fixed
a couple. With the new process, expect a new release from me
in the coming week.
