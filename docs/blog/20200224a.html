Subject	This week in KISS (#12)
From	Dylan Araps &lt;dylan@k1ss.org&gt;
Date	Mon, 24 Feb 2020 15:07:09 +0100


A thankfully quiet week this one was. The regular old package updates
and a lot of new documentation. Thanks to the ease of the new site
I'm actually enjoying the writing process now.

<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6799467/81232045-dc5f8700-8ffc-11ea-9c30-c2769b790b66.jpg">

</a>

Expect a large influx of documentation over the coming weeks. There's
a new "Frequently Asked Questions" page which I am writing as
questions coming in (rather than preempting what I _think_ will be
asked).


WEBSITE CHANGES

The website is now hosted on GitHub pages due to Netlify's new
build minutes policy and KISS' lack of eligibility for their open
source offering.

We lose out on nice features such as control over redirects, the
hook features which enabled Wiki mirroring etc though I'm not too
worried about it. It is what it is.

The website sources are now a lot simpler than they were. Builds now
take less than a second to complete and there's a lot less
boilerplate tying the whole thing together.

The 'docs' directory contains the compiled version of the site and
the 'site' directory contains the sources.

LAPTOP TROUBLES

The charger for my laptop decided it didn't want to live anymore.
With hope and a roll of tape I managed to get it running again
(within a day) while I awaited a new charger which just arrived
(a day later).

Shipping here (Greece) is wonderful. Cash on delivery as an option
instead of a card (or Paypal/equivalent) and next day delivery with
a courier.

I'm on an island so the next day delivery was a shock. There's no
address where I live either so the courier delivers  the package
wherever you are at that moment.

Think of it as delivery to a name (or person) instead of to a
defined (and mappable) location.


THANKS AND WELCOME

I'd like to thank everyone for their continue support. I hope you're
all enjoying KISS. I'll also give a big welcome to the influx of new
users this week. Enjoy your stay and let it be a long one.

Onward to greater things.
