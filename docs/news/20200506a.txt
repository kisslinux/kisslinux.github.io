The 'firefox' package will now follow the latest release instead of
the ESR. The ESR version of Firefox is additionally available via 
the 'firefox-esr' package for those wanting a browser with less
surprises..

To complement the changes, 'firefox-bin' now provides the latest
release and 'firefox-bin-esr', the ESR release. The '-bin' packages 
are in the process of being built and will be released shortly.
